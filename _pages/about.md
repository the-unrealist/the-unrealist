Hey, I'm Matt! I've been teaching myself the ins and outs of Unreal Engine since early 2022. This blog is my personal notebook dedicated to sharing the things I've learned along the way.

I'm a full stack software engineer at Google by day. I'm not actively seeking a change in career right now, but I am always open to interesting opportunities.

Please send inquiries either by direct message on Twitter [@unrealist-matt](https://twitter.com/unrealist_matt) or by email at [inquiries@unrealistâ€¤org](mailto:inquiries@unrealist.org).

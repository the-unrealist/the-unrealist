This is the second chapter in the [Lyra Deep Dive](https://unrealist.org/lyra-part-1) series.

## What are Experiences?
TODO: Mention that most of the code is in the `GameModes` folder

## Source Code
[View the source code for this chapter ‚ù≠](https://github.com/the-unrealist/lyra-deep-dive/tree/chapter2-experiences)

I recommend looking at the [diff](https://github.com/the-unrealist/lyra-deep-dive/compare/chapter1-introduction...chapter2-experiences) to see what's changed since the previous chapter.

## Plugins
### Game Features
The Lyra Experience system makes use of the [Game Features plugin](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/game-features-and-modular-gameplay-in-unreal-engine/) so that experiences can be contained as game feature plugins and loaded at runtime.

### Modular Gameplay
The [Modular Gameplay plugin](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/game-framework-component-manager-in-unreal-engine/) makes it possible for actors to register themselves as receivers for components. It's usually used in conjunction with the Game Features plugin to make actors extensible via plugins and avoid coupling the actor with the feature.

Actors you want to make modular will need to register themselves with the `UGameFrameworkComponentManager`. This is typically done in the `PreInitializeComponents` function of the actor.

```cpp
void AMyModularActor::PreInitializeComponents()
{
    Super::PreInitializeComponents();
    UGameFrameworkComponentManager::AddGameFrameworkComponentReceiver(this);
}
```

Actors also need to unregister themselves when they're no longer accepting extensions. This is typically done in the `EndPlay` function of the actor.

```cpp
void AMyModularActor::EndPlay(const EEndPlayReason::Type EndPlayReason)
{
    UGameFrameworkComponentManager::RemoveGameFrameworkComponentReceiver(this);
    Super::EndPlay(EndPlayReason);
}
```

Modular actors can create custom extension points by broadcasting custom events to any object listening to the actor.

Most modular actors will want to send the `GameActorReady` event in `BeginPlay` so that listeners can execute code only when the actor is active.

```cpp
void AMyModularActor::BeginPlay()
{
    UGameFrameworkComponentManager::SendGameFrameworkComponentExtensionEvent(this, UGameFrameworkComponentManager::NAME_GameActorReady);
    Super::BeginPlay();
}
```

To handle actor extensions, call `AddExtensionHandler` in the `UGameFrameworkComponentManager` subsystem. This will subscribe to all actors of the desired class for extension events. It must be an actor subclass and not the root `AActor` class, which means you _cannot_ subscribe to every single actor. This is intentionally checked to prevent significant performance impact to the game.

```cpp
// This snippet is placed where you want to start handling actor extensions.
if (UGameFrameworkComponentManager* ComponentManager = UGameInstance::GetSubsystem<UGameFrameworkComponentManager>(GameInstance))
{			
    TSoftClassPtr<AActor> ReceiverClass = AMyModularActor::StaticClass();
    
    TSharedPtr<FComponentRequestHandle> ExtensionRequestHandle = ComponentManager->AddExtensionHandler(
        ReceiverClass,
        UGameFrameworkComponentManager::FExtensionHandlerDelegate::CreateUObject(this, &ThisClass::HandleActorExtension));
}
```

Store `ExtensionRequestHandle` somewhere. Call `Unregister` on it to stop listening for extension events.

In the handler delegate, you typically would check the event name and execute code on the actor if it's an event you wish to handle.

```cpp
void UMyActorExtensionHandler::HandleActorExtension(AActor* Actor, FName EventName)
{
    if (EventName == UGameFrameworkComponentManager::NAME_GameActorReady)
    {
        // Do something when the actor is ready.
    }
    
    // Handle other extension events here if needed.
}
```

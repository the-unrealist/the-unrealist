# Lyra Deep Dive - Part 1: Experiences

## Introduction
[Lyra](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/lyra-sample-game-in-unreal-engine/) is a sample game created by Epic Games to demonstrate Unreal Engine frameworks.

This is the first part in a series of technical deep dives for Lyra. In these deep dives, I'll recreate the essence of Lyra from scratch step-by-step. I have no intention of 
covering everything Lyra has to offer, but I will keep going until when I've felt like I've gone far enough, which may be an arbitrary decision. ðŸ˜Š

Articles like this one are essentially my personal notes I've written while exploring Lyra and cleaned up for everybody else to read. Unreal Engine is *massive* and Lyra introduces
numerous new features on top of an already massive codebase. It helps me to better understand (and remember) how to do things and how they work if I flesh out my notes to make them
useful for not just myself but everyone else too.

**All code provided in this series are excerpts of the Lyra source code that are copyrighted by Epic Games and subject to the 
[Unreal Engine End User License Agreement](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/eula/unreal).**

Another important thing to note is that I will omit parts of the code if they are not relevant at that point in time. Omitted code will generally be replaced with a comment so that
you'll know there's more to the code than what I've shown.

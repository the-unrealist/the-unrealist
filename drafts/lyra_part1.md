# Lyra Deep Dive - Chapter 1: Introduction

## Introduction
[Lyra](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/lyra-sample-game-in-unreal-engine/) is a sample game created by Epic Games to demonstrate Unreal Engine frameworks.

This is the first chapter in my Lyra deep dive. I am recreating the essence of Lyra step-by-step from scratch focusing on one feature at a time. I have no intention of covering everything Lyra has to offer, but I will keep going until when I've felt like I've gone far enough, which may be an arbitrary decision. ðŸ˜Š

Since this is a technical deep dive, I will assume the reader (that's you) can read C++ and has more than just a surface level understanding of Unreal Engine.

Articles like this one are essentially my personal notes I've written while exploring Unreal Engine and cleaned up to share with the public. Unreal Engine is *massive* and Lyra introduces numerous new features on top of an already massive codebase. It helps me to better understand (and remember) how to do things and how they work if I flesh out my notes to make them useful for not just myself but everyone else too.

I will omit parts of the code when they are not yet relevant. Omitted code often will be replaced with a comment so that you'll know there's more to the code than what I've shown. In fact, all comments from me in the code will have the `Citrus:` prefix.

As Lyra is still under development, it's probable for some details in this series to become out of date.

## The Initial Project
âŒªâŒªâŒª **[View the source code for this section](https://github.com/the-unrealist/lyra-deep-dive)** âŒ©âŒ©âŒ©

Let's begin with a blank C++ project with four targets:

|Target Name|Outcome|
|-----------|-------|
|`LyraEditor`|Produces an editor build that contains both the game and the Unreal Editor. Use this target to launch the Unreal Editor.|
|`LyraServer`|TODO|
|`LyraClient`|TODO|
|`LyraGame`|TODO|

`LyraGameEOS` is another target in Lyra but let's skip that for now. It's a variant of `LyraGame` with specific config overrides for [Epic Online Services](https://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/services).

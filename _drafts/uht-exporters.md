# Extending the Unreal Header Tool (UHT) with Plugins

## About the Unreal Header Tool
The Unreal Header Tool (UHT) parses and generates code for `UObject` types. Many of the C++ macros in the Unreal Engine source code are actually implemented by the UHT.

For example, given a simple `UObject`:

```cpp
// File: Example.h

#pragma once

#include "Example.generated.h"

/** This is an example UObject. */
UCLASS()
class UExample : public UObject
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
};
```

The UHT generates [two files named `Example.generated.h` and `Example.gen.cpp`](https://gist.github.com/the-unrealist/0aa6b16d1a89c13cd0065b685b9a0bce) with code generated for the `UCLASS()` and `GENERATED_BODY()` macros.

This is how Unreal implements [reflection](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/unreal-object-handling-in-unreal-engine/#run-timetypeinformationandcasting) and [garbage collection](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/unreal-object-handling-in-unreal-engine/#garbagecollection) in a language that does not support these. Serialization, network replication, and editor integration are also implemented as generated code.

## Exporters
C++ code generation is implemented as an **exporter** in the UHT.

An exporter processes the parsed code and then optionally *exports* files to the `Intermediate` directory. An exporter may serve as an analyzer and not export any filesâ€”as demonstrated in the `Stats` exporter sample.

UHT implements these exporters under `/Engine/Source/Programs/Shared/EpicGames.UHT/Exporters/`.

|Name|Enabled by default?|Purpose|
|----|-------------------|-------|
|CodeGen|Yes|Generates C++ code for the `UObject` system.|
|Json|No|A sample exporter that shows how to output files. This exporter dumps all UObjects as a JSON file for each package.|
|Stats|No|A sample exporter that shows how to log details about types in the codebase.|

Exporters that are not enabled by default are triggered by adding `-<EXPORTER_NAME>` to the commandline arguments.

The following command will execute both the `Stats` and `Json` exporters. Replace `MyGameEditor`, `Win64`, and `Development` with the desired target, platform, and build configuration. 

```shell
C:\UE_5.3\Engine\Build\BatchFiles>RunUBT.bat -Mode=UnrealHeaderTool -Stats -Json "-Target=MyGameEditor Win64 Development -Project=\"C:/Path/To/MyGame.uproject\""
```

## Extending the UHT with plugins
The Unreal Build Tool (UBT) scans for [extension plugins](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/unreal-header-tool-for-unreal-engine/#extendinguhtwithscriptgenerators) in both engine and your game's source, and automatically activates them. At this time, only exporters are supported in plugins.

I created a UBT plugin called [**Specifier Reference Viewer**](https://github.com/the-unrealist/specifier-reference-viewer) that scans for all specifier keywords used in the source code for the engine, game, and all plugins. At the time of writing, it only generates [a JSON file with every specifier in use](https://github.com/the-unrealist/specifier-reference-viewer/blob/main/specifiers.json), but I plan on extending it to integrate with the editor in several ways.

Let's walk through how I developed this plugin.

### 1. Create a plugin
Create a `.uplugin` with at least one module. A module is required even if you're not outputting any file, and it must have the `Runtime` type.

```jsonc
{
    // ...
    "EnabledByDefault": false,
    "Modules": [
        {
            "Name": "SpecifierReferenceViewer",
            "Type": "Runtime",
            "LoadingPhase": "PreDefault"
        }
    ]
}
```

### 2. Enable the plugin in the editor
In your game's `.uproject` file, explicitly enable the plugin for the `Editor` target.
```jsonc
{
    "Plugins": [
        {
            "Name": "SpecifierReferenceViewer",
            "Enabled": true,
            "TargetAllowList": [
                "Editor"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

When the user interface is open in most modern games, you'll find a list of actions available to the player.
This is typically a horizontal bar located at the bottom of the screen.

Here's a few:

**Destiny**

**Animal Crossing: New Horizons**

And, of course... **Fortnite**!

The Common UI plugin was originally developed for Fortnite and the action bar we'll be creating in this tutorial is the same as the one used in the game! 
In case you're not aware, this article is part of a series about the [Common UI plugin](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/common-ui-plugin-for-advanced-user-interfaces-in-unreal-engine/).
Common UI is a cross-platform UI plugin developed by Epic Games for Unreal Engine.

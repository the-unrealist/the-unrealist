This is the **third** chapter in the [Lyra Deep Dive](https://unrealist.org/lyra-part-1/) series.

In the [previous chapter](https://unrealist.org/lyra-part-2/), we've learned about how experiences are defined. In this chapter, we'll take a deep dive into the lifecycle of an experience.

## Experience Lifecycle
`ALyraGameState` automatically adds `ULyraExperienceManagerComponent` to itself in its constructor. This component handles the entire lifecycle of an experience.

The lifecycle of an experience begins with `ALyraGameMode` on the server calling `SetCurrentExperience` and replicating `CurrentExperience` to all clients.

The loading process starts immediately on the server. For clients, the loading process starts after `CurrentExperience` is replicated.

|Function|Target|Outcome|

|`SetCurrentExperience`|Server|Set `CurrentExperience` which is replicated to all clients and call `StartExperienceLoad` on the server.|
|`OnRep_CurrentExperience`|Client|Call `StartExperienceLoad`|
|`StartExperienceLoad`|Client & Server|Load experience definition, associated assets, and asset bundles.|
|`OnExperienceLoadComplete`|Client & Server|Load and activate game feature plugins.|

||||
|`EndPlay`|Client & Server|Deactivate and unload game features.|
|`OnAllActionsDeactivated`|Client & Server|Clear `CurrentExperience`.|

The `LoadState` property reflects the current state of the experience. The following diagram shows the transition between states:

Let's take a closer look at each stage of the lifecycle.

## Replication
`ULyraExperienceManagerComponent` has a function `SetCurrentExperience`.

```cpp
// File: LyraExperienceManagerComponent.h

void SetCurrentExperience(FPrimaryAssetId ExperienceId);
```

```cpp
// File: LyraExperienceManagerComponent.cpp

void ULyraExperienceManagerComponent::SetCurrentExperience(FPrimaryAssetId ExperienceId)
{
    ULyraAssetManager& AssetManager = ULyraAssetManager::Get();
    FSoftObjectPath AssetPath = AssetManager.GetPrimaryAssetPath(ExperienceId);
    TSubclassOf<ULyraExperienceDefinition> AssetClass = Cast<UClass>(AssetPath.TryLoad());
    check(AssetClass);
    const ULyraExperienceDefinition* Experience = GetDefault<ULyraExperienceDefinition>(AssetClass);

    check(Experience != nullptr);
    check(CurrentExperience == nullptr);
    CurrentExperience = Experience;
    StartExperienceLoad();
}
```

In `SetCurrentExperience`, the server does the following:

1. Synchronously load the experience *definition*.
2. Verify the experience definition was loaded successfully.
3. Set CurrentExperience which will trigger replication to all clients.
4. Call `StartExperienceLoad` to start the experience lifecycle on the server.

```cpp
// File: LyraExperienceManagerComponent.h

UPROPERTY(ReplicatedUsing=OnRep_CurrentExperience)
TObjectPtr<const ULyraExperienceDefinition> CurrentExperience;

UFUNCTION()
void OnRep_CurrentExperience();
```

```cpp
// File: LyraExperienceManagerComponent.cpp

void ULyraExperienceManagerComponent::OnRep_CurrentExperience()
{
    StartExperienceLoad();
}
```

`OnRep_CurrentExperience` is executed on all clients when `CurrentExperience` is replicated from the server. This function then calls `StartExperienceLoad` to start the experience lifecycle on the client.

## Stage 1: Load Experience Definition
The experience definition and all associated assets\* are asynchronously loaded in this stage.

\*Only assets that are directly referenced by the experience definition are loaded here like, for example, HUD widgets in the **Add Widgets** action. All other assets in game feature plugins are loaded in the next stage.

`StartExperienceLoad` begins by populating `BundleAssetList` with a set of primary asset IDs including the experience definition itself and any linked action sets.

```cpp
// Function: StartExperienceLoad()

TSet<FPrimaryAssetId> BundleAssetList;

BundleAssetList.Add(CurrentExperience->GetPrimaryAssetId());
for (const TObjectPtr<ULyraExperienceActionSet>& ActionSet : CurrentExperience->ActionSets)
{
    if (ActionSet != nullptr)
    {
        BundleAssetList.Add(ActionSet->GetPrimaryAssetId());
    }
}
```

Next, it determines the [asset bundles](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/asset-management-in-unreal-engine/#assetbundles) to load.

```cpp
// Function: StartExperienceLoad()

TArray<FName> BundlesToLoad;
BundlesToLoad.Add(FLyraBundles::Equipped);

const ENetMode OwnerNetMode = GetOwner()->GetNetMode();
const bool bLoadClient = GIsEditor || (OwnerNetMode != NM_DedicatedServer);
const bool bLoadServer = GIsEditor || (OwnerNetMode != NM_Client);
if (bLoadClient)
{
    BundlesToLoad.Add(UGameFeaturesSubsystemSettings::LoadStateClient);
}
if (bLoadServer)
{
    BundlesToLoad.Add(UGameFeaturesSubsystemSettings::LoadStateServer);
}
```

|Asset Bundle Name|Purpose|Used By|
|-----------------|-------|-------|
|`Equipped`|Assets in this bundle are always loaded.|None (as of UE 5.1)|
|`Client`|Assets to load on clients or PIE.|HUD Widgets, Input Configs, and Ability Sets|
|`Server`|Assets to load on dedicated servers or PIE.|Input Configs and Ability Sets|

The assets and asset bundles are loaded with a call to `ChangeBundleStateForPrimaryAssets`. You may notice that the async handle for this operation, `BundleLoadHandle`, is then combined with `RawLoadHandle`. `LoadAssetList` loads all secondary assets added to `RawAssetList`. However, this is unused right now and you won't need it.

```cpp
// Function: StartExperienceLoad()

const TSharedPtr<FStreamableHandle> BundleLoadHandle = AssetManager.ChangeBundleStateForPrimaryAssets(BundleAssetList.Array(), BundlesToLoad, {}, false, FStreamableDelegate(), FStreamableManager::AsyncLoadHighPriority);
const TSharedPtr<FStreamableHandle> RawLoadHandle = AssetManager.LoadAssetList(RawAssetList.Array(), FStreamableDelegate(), FStreamableManager::AsyncLoadHighPriority, TEXT("StartExperienceLoad()"));

// If both async loads are running, combine them
TSharedPtr<FStreamableHandle> Handle = nullptr;
if (BundleLoadHandle.IsValid() && RawLoadHandle.IsValid())
{
    Handle = AssetManager.GetStreamableManager().CreateCombinedHandle({ BundleLoadHandle, RawLoadHandle });
}
else
{
    Handle = BundleLoadHandle.IsValid() ? BundleLoadHandle : RawLoadHandle;
}

FStreamableDelegate OnAssetsLoadedDelegate = FStreamableDelegate::CreateUObject(this, &ThisClass::OnExperienceLoadComplete);
if (!Handle.IsValid() || Handle->HasLoadCompleted())
{
    // Assets were already loaded, call the delegate now
    FStreamableHandle::ExecuteDelegate(OnAssetsLoadedDelegate);
}
else
{
    Handle->BindCompleteDelegate(OnAssetsLoadedDelegate);

    Handle->BindCancelDelegate(FStreamableDelegate::CreateLambda([OnAssetsLoadedDelegate]()
    {
        OnAssetsLoadedDelegate.ExecuteIfBound();
    }));
}
```

When the async load operation is complete, it calls `OnExperienceLoadComplete` which brings us to the next stage.

At the end of `StartExperienceLoad`, certain assets may be preloaded without blocking the game. This is also unused at this time.

## Stage 2: Load Game Features
Game features are loaded and activated in this stage.

`OnExperienceLoadComplete` begins by collecting all game feature plugins from the experience definition and all linked action sets, filtering out duplicates and invalid names.

```cpp
// Function: OnExperienceLoadComplete()

GameFeaturePluginURLs.Reset();

auto CollectGameFeaturePluginURLs = [This=this](const UPrimaryDataAsset* Context, const TArray<FString>& FeaturePluginList)
{
    for (const FString& PluginName : FeaturePluginList)
    {
        FString PluginURL;
        if (UGameFeaturesSubsystem::Get().GetPluginURLByName(PluginName, /*out*/ PluginURL))
        {
            This->GameFeaturePluginURLs.AddUnique(PluginURL);
        }
        else
        {
            ensureMsgf(false, TEXT("OnExperienceLoadComplete failed to find plugin URL from PluginName %s for experience %s - fix data, ignoring for this run"), *PluginName, *Context->GetPrimaryAssetId().ToString());
        }
    }
};

CollectGameFeaturePluginURLs(CurrentExperience, CurrentExperience->GameFeaturesToEnable);
for (const TObjectPtr<ULyraExperienceActionSet>& ActionSet : CurrentExperience->ActionSets)
{
    if (ActionSet != nullptr)
    {
        CollectGameFeaturePluginURLs(ActionSet, ActionSet->GameFeaturesToEnable);
    }
}
```

When there is at least one valid game feature, it asynchronously loads and activates each one of them using a counter `NumGameFeaturePluginsLoading` to keep track of the number of plugins left to load.

```cpp
// Function: OnExperienceLoadComplete()

NumGameFeaturePluginsLoading = GameFeaturePluginURLs.Num();
if (NumGameFeaturePluginsLoading > 0)
{
    LoadState = ELyraExperienceLoadState::LoadingGameFeatures;
    for (const FString& PluginURL : GameFeaturePluginURLs)
    {
        ULyraExperienceManager::NotifyOfPluginActivation(PluginURL);
        UGameFeaturesSubsystem::Get().LoadAndActivateGameFeaturePlugin(PluginURL, FGameFeaturePluginLoadComplete::CreateUObject(this, &ThisClass::OnGameFeaturePluginLoadComplete));
    }
}
else
{
    OnExperienceFullLoadCompleted();
}
```

When a game feature is activated, it invokes `OnGameFeaturePluginLoadComplete` which decreases the counter.

```cpp
void ULyraExperienceManagerComponent::OnGameFeaturePluginLoadComplete(const UE::GameFeatures::FResult& Result)
{
    // decrement the number of plugins that are loading
    NumGameFeaturePluginsLoading--;

    if (NumGameFeaturePluginsLoading == 0)
    {
        OnExperienceFullLoadCompleted();
    }
}
```

`OnExperienceFullLoadCompleted` is called when there are no more game features left to load which brings us to the next stage.

## Stage 3. Chaos Testing
This stage is optional and disabled by default. When enabled, a random delay is added to the load time here. This can help you test your game by having staggered client readiness.

To configure chaos testing, use these console variables:

|CVar|Description|
|----|-----------|
|`lyra.chaos.ExperienceDelayLoad.MinSecs`|This value (in seconds) will be added as a delay of load completion of the experience (along with the random value `lyra.chaos.ExperienceDelayLoad.RandomSecs`)|
|`lyra.chaos.ExperienceDelayLoad.RandomSecs`|A random amount of time between 0 and this value (in seconds) will be added as a delay of load completion of the experience (along with the fixed value `lyra.chaos.ExperienceDelayLoad.MinSecs`)|

## Stage 4. Execute Game Feature Actions
Game feature actions are executed in the order as they appear in the experience definition and then each action set.

```cpp
FGameFeatureActivatingContext Context;

// Only apply to our specific world context if set
const FWorldContext* ExistingWorldContext = GEngine->GetWorldContextFromWorld(GetWorld());
if (ExistingWorldContext)
{
    Context.SetRequiredWorldContextHandle(ExistingWorldContext->ContextHandle);
}

auto ActivateListOfActions = [&Context](const TArray<UGameFeatureAction*>& ActionList)
{
    for (UGameFeatureAction* Action : ActionList)
    {
        if (Action != nullptr)
        {
            Action->OnGameFeatureRegistering();
            Action->OnGameFeatureLoading();
            Action->OnGameFeatureActivating(Context);
        }
    }
};

ActivateListOfActions(CurrentExperience->Actions);
for (const TObjectPtr<ULyraExperienceActionSet>& ActionSet : CurrentExperience->ActionSets)
{
    if (ActionSet != nullptr)
    {
        ActivateListOfActions(ActionSet->Actions);
    }
}
```

Finally, the experience is fully loaded at this point.

The game is notified that the experience has finished loading via the `OnExperienceLoaded` delegates.

```cpp
OnExperienceLoaded_HighPriority.Broadcast(CurrentExperience);
OnExperienceLoaded_HighPriority.Clear();

OnExperienceLoaded.Broadcast(CurrentExperience);
OnExperienceLoaded.Clear();

OnExperienceLoaded_LowPriority.Broadcast(CurrentExperience);
OnExperienceLoaded_LowPriority.Clear();
```

You may notice that it clears all delegates after broadcasting. This is because the `CallOrRegister_OnExperienceLoaded` functions for all priorities check whether the experience has been loaded and executes the callback immediately if so. Otherwise, it adds to the delegate to be called later.

|Delegate|Used For|
|--------|-------|
|`OnExperienceLoaded_HighPriority`|Frontend (`ULyraFrontendStateComponent`) and Team Creation (`ULyraTeamCreationComponent`)|
|`OnExperienceLoaded`|Spawning Pawns (`ALyraGameMode` and `ALyraPlayerState`)|
|`OnExperienceLoaded_LowPriority`|Bots (`ULyraBotCreationComponent`)|

## Stage 5. Deactivate Experience
When `EndPlay` on the component is triggered, all loaded game feature plugins are asynchronously deactivated.

At this time, Lyra does not unload game features after they've been deactivated. Ideally, it should've called `UGameFeaturesSubsystem::UnloadGameFeaturePlugin` at some point in the deactivation logic. Maybe we'll see that in a future version.

In this article, we'll learn about the types of switchers in the [Common UI plugin](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/common-ui-plugin-for-advanced-user-interfaces-in-unreal-engine/) and how to leverage them to create tabs.

Common UI is a cross-platform UI plugin developed by Epic Games for Unreal Engine 5. There are few [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTB5y-03SnE) on YouTube covering the basics of Common UI and [how it's used in Lyra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u06GAVxyIag), but they haven't explained how to create **switchers**, **tabs**, and **carousels**. There is a lack of documentation for Common UI that I'm hoping to help fill in here. For that reason, this tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of Common UI including setting up inputs and styling.

## Introduction
[Lyra](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/lyra-sample-game-in-unreal-engine/) is a sample game created by Epic Games to demonstrate Unreal Engine frameworks.

This is the first chapter in my Lyra deep dive. I am recreating the essence of Lyra step-by-step from scratch focusing on one feature at a time. I have no intention of covering everything Lyra has to offer, but I will keep going until when I've felt like I've gone far enough, which may be an arbitrary decision. üòä

Since this is a technical deep dive, I will assume the reader (that's you) can read C++ and has more than just a surface level understanding of Unreal Engine.

Articles like this one are essentially my personal notes I've written while exploring Unreal Engine and cleaned up to share with the public. Unreal Engine is *massive* and Lyra introduces numerous new features on top of an already massive codebase. It helps me to better understand (and remember) how to do things and how they work if I flesh out my notes to make them useful for not just myself but everyone else too.

I will omit parts of the code when they are not yet relevant. Omitted code often will be replaced with a comment so that you'll know there's more to the code than what I've shown. In fact, all comments from me in the code will have the `Citrus:` prefix.

As Lyra is still under development, it's probable for some details in this series to become out of date.

## Source Code

## The Initial Project
We'll begin with a blank C++ project with four targets:

|Target Name|Outcome|
|-----------|-------|
|`LyraEditor`|Editor build that contains both the game and the Unreal Editor. Use this target to launch the Unreal Editor.|
|`LyraServer`|A dedicated server.|
|`LyraClient`|A game client without server code.|
|`LyraGame`|A standalone game with both client and server code.|

`LyraGameEOS` is another target in Lyra but let's skip that for now. It's a variant of `LyraGame` with specific config overrides for [Epic Online Services](https://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/services).

All targets call `ApplySharedLyraTargetSettings` in `LyraGameTarget`. This method configures common settings based on the target type. I am leaving most of the implementation out because it's not relevant yet.

## Logging
Custom log channels make it easier to identify which feature generated a log message, warning, or error, and provides finer control over log verbosity. Lyra implements multiple log channels used by various features, but most channels are not relevant yet so we'll leave these out for now.

Let's start with `LogLyra` and `LogLyraEditor` to be used as a generic catch-all channel for the game and editor respectively.

In `LyraGame`, the log channels are defined in `LyraLogChannels.h` and implemented in `LyraLogChannels.cpp`. 

There's also a global helper function `GetClientServerContextString` implemented here. This function is used by actors and actor components to log their network context, i.e., running on either the client or server, or none if not networked.

```cpp
// LyraEditor.h
LYRAGAME_API DECLARE_LOG_CATEGORY_EXTERN(LogLyra, Log, All);
LYRAGAME_API FString GetClientServerContextString(UObject* ContextObject = nullptr);

// LyraEditor.cpp
DEFINE_LOG_CATEGORY(LogLyra);
FString GetClientServerContextString(UObject* ContextObject) { /* Implementation */ }
```

The only custom log channel in `LogEditor` is defined in `LyraEditor.h` and implemented in `LyraEditor.cpp`. There's no rule for where the channel has to be defined, but since there's only one log channel in the editor module, it's fine to put it in the same file as the module implementation.

## Next Steps
Now that we have a properly structured project with appropriate build targets and log channels, we can begin exploring what Lyra has to offer!

In the next chapter, we will implement the **Lyra Experiences** system.

[Common UI](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/common-ui-plugin-for-advanced-user-interfaces-in-unreal-engine/) is a cross-platform UI plugin developed by Epic Games for Unreal Engine 5. There are [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTB5y-03SnE) on YouTube covering the basics of Common UI, but I haven't found any that covers advanced widgets such as **tabs**, **carousels**, and other types of **switchers**. There is a lack of documentation for Common UI that I'm hoping to help fill in here. For that reason, this tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of Common UI including setting up inputs and styling.

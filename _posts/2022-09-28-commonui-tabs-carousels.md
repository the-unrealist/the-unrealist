[Common UI](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/common-ui-plugin-for-advanced-user-interfaces-in-unreal-engine/) is a cross-platform UI plugin for Unreal Engine 5. As it is the case with the rest of Unreal Engine, there is a lack of documentation for Common UI that I'm hoping to help fill in here. I've seen [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTB5y-03SnE) on YouTube on the basics of Common UI, but I haven't found any that covers advanced widgets such as **tabs**, **carousels**, and other types of switchers. For that reason, this tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of Common UI including setting up inputs and styling.
